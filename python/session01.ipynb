    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.\n",

In python variable names must start with a letter (i.e. a-z).  The convention is that variable names should start with a lower case letter.  If your variable name has more than one word the separate the words with underscores (_).\n",
